### 🔥 Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on a sample of data or the entire population. It involves formulating a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1), collecting data, and using statistical tests to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
